<div id="references">
    <sa href="ready"/>, <sa href="Map"/>, <sa href="map.Container"/>
</div>
<p>
    Map size is determined when it is created by the container manager.
    After this, the map does not track possible changes to its size.
    In order for the map to change its size to the current size,
    call the <sa href="map.Container#fitToViewport">fitToViewport()</sa> function.
</p>
<p>
    If you copy the full code of the example to a new HTML document,
    the opened map will take up the entire browser viewport.

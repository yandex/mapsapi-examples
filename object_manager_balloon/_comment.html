    <sa href="ObjectManager"/> - A class for adding a large number of objects to the map
    without needing to create placemarks individually.
</p>
<p>
    Objects added in ObjectManager are in the ObjectManager.objects collection.
    The clusters formed from the added placemarks are added to the ObjectManager.clusters collection.
</p>
<p>
    These collections have managers that control balloons and hints (ObjectManager.objects.balloon, ObjectManager.clusters.hint).

<div id="references">
    <sa href="ready"/>,
    <sa href="Map"/>
</div>
<p>
    In this example, the map is created when the "Show map" button is clicked.
</p>
<p>
    At first, an empty div container is placed on the page. The bind() function is used for the "button" element
    to assign a handler for the click event, which creates the map and puts it in the specified container when called.
</p>
<p>
    If the map has already been created when the button is clicked, the destroy() method is called and it destroys the map.
